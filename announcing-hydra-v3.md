# Announcing Hydra v3

Hydra v3 is already in the works. Here are the main features planned:

- Support for filtering by relations
- Support for adding relations to variant types
- Ordering by multiple fields
- Multiple filters in the same query (`AND` and `OR`)
- Define block ranges for any mapping, i.e. specify that your mapping X should be run only from block 5 to block 7
- Import all model files from a single library. Instead of the cumbersome

```typescript
import { MyEntity1 } from '../generated/graphql-server/my-entity2/my-entity2.model'
import { MyEntity2 } from '../generated/graphql-server/my-entity2/my-entity2.model'
```

write

```typescript
import { MyEntity1, MyEntity2 } from '../generated/graphql-server/model'
```
